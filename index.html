            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City, with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It was</p>
            <p>chosen in 1983 as one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational Education Project (TVEP) of the then</p>
            <p>Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth and</p>
            <p>development in the country.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The college was an accredited regional trade skills training and testing center in Region 1 by the Technical Education and Skills</p>
            <p>Development Authority (TESDA) and a regional training center in ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center of</p>
            <p>the Philippines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one among 18 established in nominated partner schools in the country under</p>
            <p>the Toyota Automotive Education Program (TAEP) of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned</p>
            <p>to become the regional skills development center in automotive servicing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program</p>
            <p>(ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. The ETEEAP is</p>
            <p>a comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives equivalencies to</p>
            <p>knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes that education and</p>
            <p>the acquisition of higher expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT degree may be granted to</p>
            <p>individuals through the recognition of their knowledge and skills gained from non-formal or informal learning. The recognition</p>
            <p>of the knowledge and skills are done through equivalency and assessment by assessors of the College.</p>

            <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) was formerly the college department of the Ilocos Norte College of Arts and Trades</p>
            <p>(INCAT) in Laoag City which was integrated into the university by P.D. 1279 or the decree creating the Mariano Marcos State</p>
            <p>University.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Upon its integration into the University, the College was originally named the Institute of Industrial Technology (IIT). </p>
            <p>Engineering and business administration courses were offered in 1983 which paved the way for the renaming of the college</p>
            <p>to the Institute of Technology (IT).  The three-year non-degree Diploma of Industrial Technology (DIT) program, which was</p>
            <p>later renamed the Diploma of Technology (DT), was offered in 1985. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1986, the engineering courses were transferred to the Batac Campus with the creation of the College of Engineering, and</p>
            <p>the business administration courses towards the establishment of the College of Economics and Management (CEM), now the</p>
            <p>College of Business, Economics, and Accountancy (CBEA) also at the main campus.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The College was renamed in 1995 to the College of Technology (COT).  To focus on tertiary education, a reengineering of the</p>
            <p>DT and GRCO non-degree programs was instituted in June 2004, which resulted in the development of a ladderized</p>
            <p>curriculum towards the four-year BSIT program.  The College was later renamed in 2004 to College of Industrial Technology</p>
            <p>(CIT) to reflect the college's role of providing education and training in specific fields of industrial technology.</p>
